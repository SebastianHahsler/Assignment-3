# Assignment-3
RedBlack Tree for Sorting Data with Insertion and Search capabilities

Run time analysis:
File Reading and parsing for 10,000 = 10,000 operations
Insertion O(10,000log10,000) ≈ 10,000 x 13.3 ≈ 133,000 operations
Single Search O(log10,000) ≈ 13.3 operations

The following are 3 searches, an insertion, an attempt at a duplicate insertion, and a search for the inserted product.
